# Pokedex Rails App

This application serves as a Pokedex, showcasing Pok√©mon details from both a local database (Offline Pokedex) and an online source via the [Poke-api-v2 API](https://github.com/rdavid1099/poke-api-v2) (Online Pokedex).

## Features
__1. Offline Pokedex:__
- Displays a list of Pok√©mon from the local database.
- Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.

__2. Online Pokedex:__
- Displays a list of Pok√©mon fetched from the Poke-api-v2.
- Users can search for Pok√©mon by name. Search results are displayed on the Pok√©mon index page.
- Clicking on a specific Pok√©mon will show detailed information about it, including an image.

__3. Efficiency and User Experience:__
- Uses pagination for efficient data retrieval and display. This ensures a smoother and faster user experience by loading data in chunks.
- Implements caching mechanisms to speed up frequently accessed data and reduce redundant API calls, enhancing user experience and application performance.
